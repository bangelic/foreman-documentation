= Creating an activation key

Subscription Manager attaches subscriptions differently depending on the following factors:

* Are there any subscriptions associated with the activation key?
* For {RHEL} 8 hosts: Is there system purpose set on the activation key?

Note that {Project} automatically attaches subscriptions only for the products installed on a host.
For subscriptions that do not list products installed on {RHEL} by default, such as the Extended Update Support (EUS) subscription, use an activation key specifying the required subscriptions.

Based on the previous factors, there is one possible scenario for subscribing with activation keys:

* Activation key that attaches subscriptions automatically.

You can configure the activation key to set system purpose attributes on hosts during registration.
This can help determine which repositories are available on the host, and also helps with reporting in the Subscriptions service of the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Lifecycle* > *Activation Keys* and click *Create Activation Key*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the activation key.
. If you want to set a limit, clear the *Unlimited hosts* checkbox, and in the *Limit* field, enter the maximum number of systems you can register with the activation key.
If you want unlimited hosts to register with the activation key, ensure the *Unlimited Hosts* checkbox is selected.

.CLI procedure
. Create the activation key:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer activation-key create \

--description "_Example Stack in the Development Environment_" \
--lifecycle-environment "_Development_" \
--content-view "_Stack_" \
--organization "_My_Organization_"
----
. Optional: For {RHEL} 8 hosts, enter the following command to configure the activation key with system purpose to set on hosts during registration to enhance subscriptions auto attachment.

----
. Obtain a list of your subscription IDs:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# hammer subscription list --organization "_My_Organization_"
