= Copying a content view

Use this procedure to copy a content view.
You can copy a content view in the {ProjectWebUI} or you can use the Hammer CLI to copy an existing content view into a new content view.

[NOTE]
====
A copied content view does not have the same history as a regular content view.
Version 1 of the content view is where a copied content view begins.
As a result, you cannot promote an older version of a content view from the copied content view.
