= Changing the Repository Sets Status in {Project}

Repository sets show available repositories to each host.
If your host is subscribed to a particular Content View and Lifecycle environment, the default repository set is limited to the repositories that are specifically available to that host.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Hosts*, and select the host whose repository sets you want to change.
. Select a host and select the *Repository sets* tab.
On the *Repository sets* tab, there is a set of available repositories available to each host with a status of *Enabled* or *Disabled*.
. Select *Override to disabled*, *Override to enabled*, or *Reset to default* from the action menus on each row to overwrite the default status.
. Optional: Verify the environment for the host in *Content view details* in the *Overview* tab.

[NOTE]
====
For hosts not in a default view or a lifecycle environment, the repository tab looks different.
It defaults to showing only the repositories that are relevant to the host.

. Select *Show all* or *Limit to environment* to view available repositories.
