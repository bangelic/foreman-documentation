= Republishing Repository and Content View Metadata

In the case of republishing repository metadata, this is used when a repository distribution does not have the content it should be distributing based on the contents of the repository.

This procedure should be used with caution, and in most cases, a complete repository sync or publishing a new Content View version are the best options.

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Select the product that includes the repository for which you want to republish metadata.
Navigate to the repository where you wish to republish metadata.
. To republish metadata for the repository, select *Republish Repository Metadata* from the *Select Action* menu. 
+
[NOTE]
====
This action is not available for repositories that implement the *Complete Mirroring* policy since the metadata is copied from the repository's upstream source rather than being generated locally.
Use *Complete sync* if your metadata for these repositories differs or is broken.
