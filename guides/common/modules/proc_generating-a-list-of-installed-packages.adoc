= Generating a List of Installed Packages

Use this procedure to generate a list of installed packages in *Report Templates*.

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Monitor* > *Report Templates*.
. Select the *Host - All Installed Packages* report template.

Under the *Editor* tab, the report template shows the hostâ€™s name with the name of the package.
There is a host filter, so it does not have to display every host you have available in the report.

. After you verify the report template, return to the *Report Templates* screen.
. To the right of *Host - All Installed Packages*, click *Generate*.
. Use the *Hosts filter* Search field to search for specific hosts filters.
. Click *Generate*.
. Click *Download*.

A spreadsheet will open to display the host and list of installed packages for that host.
