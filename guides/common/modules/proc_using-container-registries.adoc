= Using container registries

Podman and Docker can be used to fetch content from container registries.
Containers are pushed to {Project}'s container registry.
The {Project} registry follows the Open Containers Initiative (OCI) specification, so you can push content to Katello by using the same methods that apply to other registries.
For more information about OCI, see https://opencontainers.org/[Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification].

.Prerequisites
* To push content to an organization or product, a user must have permissions to create repositories.

.Container registries on {SmartProxies}
On {SmartProxies} with content, the https://github.com/Katello/smart_proxy_container_gateway[Container Gateway] {SmartProxy} plugin acts as the container registry.
It caches authentication information from Katello and proxies incoming requests to Pulp.
The Container Gateway is available by default on {SmartProxies} with content.
endif::[]

.Limitations on container registries
* A repository in Katello is created after the content is pushed.
* Content is pulled as soon as it is pushed.
* Content can only be pushed to the {Project} itself.
* If pushed content needs to be on {SmartProxies} as well, use {SmartProxy} syncing.
* The pushed container name must contain only lowercase characters.
* Unless pushed repositories are published in a content view version, they do not follow the Registry Name Pattern.
This is to ensure that users can push and pull from the same path.
* Users are required to push and pull from the same path.
If a user uses the label-based schema, they pull using labels.
If a user uses the ID-based schema, they pull using IDs.

.Procedure
Logging in to the container registry:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman login {foreman-example-com}
----

Listing container images:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman search {foreman-example-com}/
----

Pulling container images:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman pull {foreman-example-com}/my-image:<optional_tag>
----

Pushing container images to the {Project} container registry:

* To indicate which organization, product, and repository the container image belongs to, use container namespaces.
* All labels are composed of entirely lowercase characters regardless of actual label capitalization.
* Pushes follow one of two formats:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman push _image_ _{foreman-example-com}_/_organization_label_/_product_label_/_repository_name_[:tag]
# podman push _image_ _{foreman-example-com}_/id/<organization_id>/<product_id>/<repository_name>[:tag]
----

* An example of a complete push:
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman push _d2c94e258dcb_ _{foreman-example-com}_/default_organization/test_product/hello-world:latest
