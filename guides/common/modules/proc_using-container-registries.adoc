= Using container registries

You can use Podman and Docker to fetch content from container registries and push containers to the {Project} container registry.
The {Project} registry follows the Open Containers Initiative (OCI) specification, so you can push content to {Project} by using the same methods that apply to other registries.
For more information about OCI, see link:https://opencontainers.org/[Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification].

.Prerequisites
* To push content to an organization or product, a user must have permissions to create repositories.
The push permission is `edit_products`.
* To pull content, a user must have permissions as long as *unauthenticated pull* is set to off by default in the lifecycle environment.
The pull permissions are `view_lifecycle_environments`, `view_products`, `view_content_views`.

.Container registries on {SmartProxies}
On {SmartProxies} with content, the https://github.com/Katello/smart_proxy_container_gateway[Container Gateway] {SmartProxy} plugin acts as the container registry.
It caches authentication information from Katello and proxies incoming requests to Pulp.
The Container Gateway is available by default on {SmartProxies} with content.

.Considerations for pushing content to the {Project} container registry
* You can only push content to the {ProjectServer} itself.
If you need pushed content on {SmartProxyServers} as well, use {SmartProxy} syncing.
* The pushed container name must contain only lowercase characters.
* Unless pushed repositories are published in a content view version, they do not follow the Registry Name Pattern.
This is to ensure that users can push and pull from the same path.
* Users are required to push and pull from the same path.
If a user uses the label-based schema, they pull using labels.
If a user uses the ID-based schema, they pull using IDs.

.Procedure
* Logging in to the container registry:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman login {foreman-example-com}
----

* Listing container images:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman search {foreman-example-com}/
----

* Pulling container images:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# podman pull {foreman-example-com}/my-image:<optional_tag>
----

* Pushing container images to the {Project} container registry:
- To indicate which organization, product, and repository the container image belongs to, include the organization and product in the container repository name.
- Push accepts the following formats:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ podman push _My_Container_Image_Hash_ _{foreman-example-com}_/_My_Organization_Label_/_My_Product_Label_/_My_Repository_Name_[:_My_Tag_]
$ podman push _My_Container_Image_Hash_ _{foreman-example-com}_/id/_My_Organization_ID_/_My_Product_ID_/_My_Repository_Name_[:_My_Tag_]
----
* After the content push has completed, a repository is created in {Project}.
