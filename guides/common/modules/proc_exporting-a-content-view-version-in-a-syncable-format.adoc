= Exporting a Content View Version in a Syncable Format

You can export a version of a Content View to a syncable format that you can use to create your custom CDN and synchronize the content from the custom CDN over HTTP/HTTPS.

ifdef::satellite[]
You can then serve the generated content through a local web server on the importing {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization.

You cannot directly import Syncable Format exports.
Instead, on the importing {ProjectServer} you must:

* Copy the generated content to an HTTP/HTTPS web server that is accessible to importing {ProjectServer}.
* Update your CDN configuration to *Custom CDN*.
* Set the CDN URL to point to the web server.
* Optional: Set an SSL/TLS CA Credential if the web server requires it.
* Enable the repository.
* Synchronize the repository.
endif::[]

ifndef::satellite[]
You can use the generated content to create the same repository in another {ProjectServer} or in another {ProjectServer} organization using content import.
On importing the exported archive, a regular Content View is created or updated on your downstream {ProjectServer}.

For more information, see xref:Importing_a_Content_View_Version_{context}[].
endif::[]

You can export the following content in a syncable format from {ProjectServer}:

* File repositories
* Kickstart repositories
* RPM repositories

You cannot export Ansible and Docker content.

ifndef::satellite[]
You cannot export DEB repositories.
endif::[]

The export contains the following data:

* Directories containing the packages, *listing* files and metadata of each repository in yum format that can be used to synchronize in the importing {ProjectServer}.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that you set the download policy to *Immediate* for all repositories within the Content View you export.
For more information, see xref:Download_Policies_Overview_{context}[].
* Ensure that you synchronize products you export to the required date.
* Ensure that the user exporting the content has the `Content Exporter` role.
