Use this procedure to upgrade your {Project} installation from Enterprise Linux 7 to Enterprise Linux 8.
LEAPP is the supported tool for Enterprise Linux 7 to Enterprise Linux 8 upgrades.

.Prerequisites
* {Project} {ProjectVersion} running on Enterprise Linux 7.
* Access to available repositories or a local mirror of repositories.
* {Project} installations running on CentOS 7 can be upgraded to CentOS Stream 8 or a {RHEL} rebuild.
* {Project} installations running on {RHEL} 7 can be upgraded to {RHEL} 8.
endif::[]

ifdef::satellite[]
.Prerequisites
* {Project} {ProjectVersion} running on {RHEL} 7.
* Access to available repositories or a local mirror of repositories.
* {Project} installations running on {RHEL} 7 can be upgraded to {RHEL} 8.

.Backup and Restore
. You can create a {RHEL} 8 system with identical specifications and the same hostname as the {RHEL} 7 system using the fresh install migration method.
. This method requires a considerable amount of system downtime while the system backup is restored on the {RHEL} 8 system.
. To reduce the amount of downtime, you can continue to use the {RHEL} 7 system on the target machine while the backup is being restored.
. Any changes you make during this time are not included in the backup on the {RHEL} 8 system on the source machine.
. Storage space is required for the backup and access to a second machine to host the new {RHEL} 8 system.

.In-Place Migration Using LEAPP
. The in-place migration method requires several hours less downtime than the fresh install method.
. You do not need to provide storage space for a backup or a second machine for {RHEL} 8, as the migration can occur in place on the {RHEL} 7 machine.
. Downtime cannot be avoided entirely by using the {RHEL} 7 system while the {RHEL} 8 system is preparing because the in-place migration occurs on the same machine.
. The in-place migration using LEAPP is not possible with FIPS-enabled systems.
endif::[]

.Procedure
. Configure the repositories to obtain LEAPP.
+
On CentOS, configure the https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/theforeman/leapp/[@theforeman/leapp COPR Repository], which contains newer LEAPP packages than those shipped by https://wiki.almalinux.org/elevate/[AlmaLinux/ELevate], and support {Project} upgrades:
+
----
# curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/theforeman-leapp.repo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/theforeman/leapp/repo/epel-7/group_theforeman-leapp-epel-7.repo
----
+
On {RHEL}, enable the `rhel-7-server-extras-rpms` repository:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
----

. Install required packages:
+
----
# {package-install-project} leapp leapp-repository
----

ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
. Install additional OS specific packages (`leapp-data-centos` for CentOS Stream, `leapp-data-rocky` for Rocky Linux, `leapp-data-almalinux` for AlmaLinux).
+
----
# yum install leapp-data-centos
----

+
. Add {Project} specific repositories to `/etc/leapp/files/leapp_upgrade_repositories.repo`:

* If you are using Puppet 6 instead of Puppet 7, replace the `7` with a `6` in the `leapp-puppet7` entry.

* You need a Puppet repository for the Puppet agent that the installer is using.

. We do not support Enterprise Linux 8 installations with EPEL 8 enabled, so remove `epel-release`:
+
----
# yum remove epel-release
----

. Remove `centos-release-scl` and `centos-release-scl-rh` repositories:
+
----
# yum remove centos-release-scl centos-release-scl-rh
----
endif::[]

. Let LEAPP analyze your system:
+
----
# leapp preupgrade
----
The first run is expected to fail but report issues.
Continue to the next step for remediation.

. Examine the report in the `/var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt` file, answer all questions (using `leapp answer`) and manually resolve the other reported problems.
The following commands show the most common steps required:
+
----
# rmmod pata_acpi
# echo PermitRootLogin yes | tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# leapp answer --section remove_pam_pkcs11_module_check.confirm=True
----

ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
+
The `preupgrade` might fail with a dependency resolution error such as:
+

* "package rubygem-fx-0.5.0-2.el8.noarch requires rubygem(railties) >= 4.0.0, but none of the providers can be installed"
* "package rubygem-railties-6.0.4.7-1.el8.noarch requires rubygem(thor) < 2.0, but none of the providers can be installed"

+
If this happens, do the following to clean up packages that cannot automatically upgrade (`rubygem(thor)` and `rubygem(railties)` in the example above):

+
----
# yum remove rubygem-thor rubygem-railties
----
endif::[]

. Ensure `leapp preupgrade` has no issues.

. Run:
+
----
# leapp upgrade
----

. Reboot the system.
+
ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
After the system reboots, a live system conducts the upgrade, reboots to fix SELinux labels, then reboots into the final Enterprise Linux 8 system.
endif::[]

ifdef::satellite[]
After the system reboots, a live system conducts the upgrade, reboots to fix SELinux labels, then reboots into the final {RHEL} 8 system.
endif::[]

. LEAPP finishes the upgrade, watch it with:
+
----
# journalctl -u leapp_resume -f
----

[NOTE]
====
If you install the system and need to use `--disable-system-checks`, the last step of the upgrade is going to fail, and you need to call `{foreman-installer} --disable-system-checks` manually once the system reboots.
