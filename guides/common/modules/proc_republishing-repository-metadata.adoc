= Republishing Repository Metadata

Republishing repository metadata is used when a repository distribution does not have the content that should be distributed based on the contents of the repository.

Use this procedure with caution.
In most cases, {Team} recommends a complete repository sync or publishing a new Content View version.

.Procedure

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Content* > *Products*.
. Select the product that includes the repository for which you want to republish metadata.
. Navigate to the repository where you want to republish metadata.
. To republish metadata for the repository, select *Republish Repository Metadata* from the *Select Action* menu.

[NOTE]
====
This action is not available for repositories that implement the *Complete Mirroring* policy since the metadata is copied from the repository's upstream source instead of being generated locally.
