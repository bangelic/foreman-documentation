= Using Ansible job templates for package and errata actions

By default, {Project} is configured to use the Script provider templates for remote execution jobs.
If you prefer using the Ansible provider templates for your remote jobs, you can configure {Project} to use the Ansible provider templates for remote execution features that take a search query input.

.Prerequisites
Use remote execution in `ssh` mode.
Pull mode does not work with Ansible.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Administer > Remote Execution Features*.
. Find each feature whose name contains `by_search`.
. Change the job template for these features from `Katello Script Default` to `Katello Ansible Default`.
. Click *Submit*.

Ansible job templates are now used for remote execution when using the web UI to perform package and errata actions, and when using hammer job-invocation created with remote execution features that take a search query input.
