[NOTE]
====
Pulp is introducing more data about container manifests to the API.
As a result, migrations must be performed to pull this content from manifests into the database.
This information allows Katello to display manifest labels, annotations, and information about the manifest type, such as if it is bootable or represents flatpak content.

ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
This migration takes time so users who depend on container content and need minimal upgrade downtime should run `foreman-maintain advanced procedure run pulpcore-container-handle-image-metadata` after upgrading.
This command migrates data in the background without any need for downtime.
endif::[]

ifdef::satellite[]
This migration takes time so it runs automatically after the upgrade to {ProjectVersion} to reduce future upgrade downtime.
While the pre-migration is running, the {Project} is fully functional but with higher resource utilization.
