Pulp is introducing more data about container manifests to the API.
This information allows Katello to display manifest labels, annotations, and information about the manifest type, such as if it is bootable or represents flatpak content.
As a result, migrations must be performed to pull this content from manifests into the database.

ifdef::foreman-el,katello[]
This migration takes time, so if you depend on container content and need minimal upgrade downtime, run the following command after upgrading for a pre-migration.

[options="nowrap" subs="attributes"]
----
# foreman-maintain advanced procedure run pulpcore-container-handle-image-metadata
----
This command migrates data in the background without any need for downtime.
endif::[]

ifdef::satellite[]
This migration takes time, so a pre-migration runs automatically after the upgrade to {ProjectVersion} to reduce future upgrade downtime.
While the pre-migration is running, the {Project} is fully functional but with higher resource utilization.
