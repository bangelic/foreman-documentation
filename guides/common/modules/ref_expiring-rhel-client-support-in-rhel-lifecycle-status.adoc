= Expiring {EL} Client Support in RHEL Lifecycle Status

{Project} provides multiple mechanisms to display information about upcoming End of Support (EOS) events for your {EL} clients.

When either the end of maintenance support or the end of extended lifecycle support approaches in a year, you will see a notification banner in the {ProjectWebUI} if you have hosts in that {EL} version.
The notification message provides information about the {EL} version, the number of hosts running that version in your environment, the lifecycle support, and the expiration date.
Along with other information, the {EL} lifecycle column is visible in the report.
For any hosts that are not running {EL}, *Unknown* will appear in the *Lifecycle Status* and *Report* column.

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts*.
. Click *Manage columns*.
. Select the  *Content* column to expand.
. Select *RHEL Lifecycle status*.
. Click *Save* to generate a new column that displays the {EL} lifecycle status with an icon.

You can also use the *Search* field to search hosts by `rhel_lifecycle_status`, `full_support`, `maintenance_support`, and `approaching_end_of_maintenance`.
You can also find the {EL} lifecycle status on the *Host status* card on the host details page.

You will see an alert on the Host page for each host that runs {EL} with an upcoming End of Support (EOS) event in a year.
