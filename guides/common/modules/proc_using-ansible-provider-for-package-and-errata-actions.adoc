= Using Ansible provider for package and errata actions

By default, {Project} is configured to use the Script provider templates for remote execution jobs.
If you prefer using Ansible job templates for your remote jobs, you can configure {Project} to use them by default for remote execution features associated with them.

.Prerequisites
* Use remote execution in `ssh` mode.

.Procedure
. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Remote Execution Features*.
. Find each feature whose name contains `by_search`.
. Change the job template for these features from `Katello Script Default` to `Katello Ansible Default`.
. Click *Submit*.

Ansible job templates are now used for remote execution when using the {ProjectWebUI} to perform package and errata actions.
They are also used when using `hammer job-invocation create` with the same remote execution features used in the procedure above.
