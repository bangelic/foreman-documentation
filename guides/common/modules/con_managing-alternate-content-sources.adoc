= Managing Alternate Content Sources

Alternate content sources define alternate paths to download content during synchronization.
The content itself is downloaded from the alternate content source and only the metadata is downloaded from the upstream URL.
You can use alternate content source to speed up synchronization if the content is located on the local filesystem or on a nearby network.
You can set up alternate content sources for {ProjectServer} and {SmartProxy}.
You must refresh the alternate content source after creation or after making any changes.
A weekly cron job refreshes all alternate content sources.
You can also refresh the alternate content sources manually using the {ProjectWebUI} or the Hammer CLI.
