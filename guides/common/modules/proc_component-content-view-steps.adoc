= Creating a Component Content View

Use the following procedure to create a Component Content View.

.Procedure
. Click *Create Content View* to create the Content View.
. In the *Repositories* tab, select the repository from the *Type* list that you want to add to your Content View.
. Select the checkbox next to the available repositories you want to add.
. Click *Add repositories*.
. Click *Publish new version* and in the *Description* field, enter information about the version to log changes.
. Optional: You can enable a promotion path by clicking *Promote* to *Select a lifecycle environment from the available promotion paths to promote new version*.
. Click *Next*.
. On the *Review* page, you can review the environments you are trying to publish.
. Click *Finish*.
[NOTE]
In the *Versions* tab after publishing, you can *Promote*, *Remove*, and *Delete* versions of the Content View under the options menu.
*Remove* and *Delete* are similar but the *Delete* option deletes an entire Content View and the versions associated with that lifecycle environment.
You can choose which version to remove from the lifecycle environment by selecting the *Remove* option.
