= Lifecycle Status of {RHEL} Hosts

{Project} provides multiple mechanisms to display information about upcoming End of Support (EOS) events for your {RHEL} clients.

When either the end of maintenance support or the end of extended lifecycle support approaches in a year, you will see a notification banner in the {ProjectWebUI} if you have hosts with that {EL} version.
The notification provides information about the {EL} version, the number of hosts running that version in your environment, the lifecycle support, and the expiration date.
Along with other information, the {EL} lifecycle column is visible in the report.
For any hosts that are not running {EL}, *Unknown* displays in the *RHEL Lifecycle status* and *Last report* columns.
