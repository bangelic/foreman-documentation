= Preparing to Migrate Content to Pulp 3

The time to prepare content for Pulp 3 depends on the amount of content and the number of Content Views.
For large systems, this can mean several days of downtime.
To prevent this, pre-migrate Pulp content while running the latest version of {ProjectServer} {ProjectVersionPrevious}.
This reduces the overall upgrade downtime.

During migration to Pulp3, the amount of data stored in the `/var/lib/pulp/published/` directory can double in size.
Ensure that there is enough space on the `/var/lib/pulp` volume.
If the user runs `{foreman-maintain} prep-6.10-upgrade`, the content in `/var/lib/pulp/content` does not need to be duplicated.
After Pulp2 is removed, the extra space can be claimed back, however, shrinking of XFS volumes is not possible and copying data to a different partition might be necessary in order to bring volume size down to the previous value.

During migration to Pulp 3, the amount of data stored in the PostgreSQL data directory can grow significantly.
Ensure that you have enough space for the migration.
A rough estimation of the space you require is 2-3 times the size of the MongoDB Pulp 2 database.

.Pre-Migration Checks
The sequence should always be if you have any Composite Content Views, take action on those first, and then work on the Content Views.

* Ensure that all enabled repositories complete the synchronization process.
* If any repositories are synced with a *Warning* or *Error* state, fix the underlying problem and resync the repository.
* Ensure that no paused tasks in the system are related to any repositories or Content Views.
* If you no longer require specific Content Views or Composite Content View Versions, you can perform a cleanup action.
* For more information about how to perform the cleanup, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2760531[How to remove old content view versions in Red Hat Satellite 6 using CLI/hammer?] .
* If some Content View or Composite Content View versions are not required anymore, please consider performing a cleanup of them.
* For more information about how to perform the cleanup of older Content View/Composite Content View versions using `hammer_cli`, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2760531[How to remove old content view versions in Red Hat Satellite 6 using CLI/hammer?].
* If you no longer require or use certain repositories, disable those specific repositories.
* When the cleanup process finishes, ensure that you clean up the orphan data by following the steps in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2639291[How to delete orphaned content in /var/lib/pulp on Capsule?].
* Ensure that you can enter the following command on {Project} without error:

//foreman-rake katello:correct_repositories COMMIT=true --trace.

Use this procedure to begin migrating content from Pulp 2 to Pulp 3.

.Procedure
. View details of the content you are pre-migrating using the following command:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-stats
----
+
Use this command as often as necessary during the migration process to determine how long the process will take.
It also identifies corrupted or missing content that might cause the migration to fail.
Output is similar to the following:

This might take some time on high latency systems.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot use *`Ctrl` + `C`* to terminate this process.
If you attempt to halt the process using *`Ctrl` + `C`* or by disconnecting your SSH session, the process does not terminate but continues in the background.
You can use the following command to terminate the process gracefully, whenever necessary, so that you can continue later.

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content prepare-abort
----

Note that `{foreman-maintain} content-prepare abort` can take several minutes to terminate the process.
You can continue the migration process using `{foreman-maintain} content-prepare` whenever it is convenient.
====

. The process does not confirm that migration is complete.
You can determine how near the process is to completion by using:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-stats
----
+
at intervals until the indicated migration time is at or near zero.
. The final steps of Pulp content migration are completed when upgrading {ProjectServer} from {ProjectVersionPrevious} to {ProjectVersion}.

[NOTE]
====
If problems occur, you can restart the pre-migration process from the beginning using the following command:

[options="nowrap", subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
# {foreman-maintain} content migration-reset
