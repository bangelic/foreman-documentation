[[post-upgrade_tasks]]

Some of the procedures in this section are optional. You can choose to perform only those procedures that are relevant to your installation.

If you use the PXE-based discovery process, then you must complete the discovery upgrade procedure on {Project} and on any {SmartProxyServer} with hosts that you want to be listed in {Project} on the *Hosts* > *Discovered hosts* page.

* The `katello-agent` is disabled with a new installation of {Project} {ProjectVersion}, making both the `qpidd` and `qdroutered` services unavailable.

* If {Project} {ProjectVersionPrevious} is upgraded to {Project} {ProjectVersion}, the `katello-agent`, as well as the `qpidd` and `qdroutered` services, remain enabled.

* If you are not using `katello-agent` and transitioned to remote execution, you can optionally disable the `katello-agent` as a post-upgrade task for both {Project} {ProjectVersion} and {SmartProxy} {ProjectVersion}:
